# Proyect Landing - Portfolio

A clean, simple and nice portfolio. Giving its use mainly to share personal projects and give details about what you most want to show, although I won't use it but will keep it as a project.

## Appendix

This project was done as practice with Adobe XD, Tailwind, Astro and JS, I definitely liked that I can finish a project and leave out the frustration I do when doing projects, as I used to delete every project because of it.
